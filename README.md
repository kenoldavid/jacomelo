Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/
Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of all sizes.


Sass - http://sass-lang.com/
Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly.

jQuery - https://jquery.com/
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
